## What is a virtual machine

A virtual machine (VM) is a software environment that emulates a complete computer system, including hardware, storage, and an operating system (OS). A VM is created by running virtualization software on a physical host machine, which allows multiple virtual machines to run on the same physical hardware, each with its own virtual hardware and OS.

## What is Vagrant

Vagrant is an open-source tool for building and managing virtual machine environments. It is designed to simplify the process of creating and managing development environments by providing a way to automate the setup of virtual machines.

## Who wrote Vagrant

Vagrant was created by Mitchell Hashimoto, an American software engineer and entrepreneur. Hashimoto first released Vagrant in 2010 while he was still a student at the University of Washington

## What is Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a popular Linux-based operating system that is open-source and free to use. It is developed and maintained by Canonical, a UK-based software company.

Ubuntu is known for its ease of use and user-friendly interface, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced Linux users. It is also widely used in enterprise and server environments, thanks to its stability, security, and support for a wide range of software packages and tools.

## What does “Ubuntu” mean

The name "Ubuntu" comes from a southern African philosophy and ethical concept that emphasizes the importance of community and mutual support. The word "Ubuntu" is derived from the Zulu and Xhosa languages, and can be roughly translated as "humanity towards others" or "I am because we are".

The Ubuntu operating system was named after this philosophy, reflecting its commitment to open-source software, community participation, and collaboration. The name also reflects the goal of making Linux and open-source software accessible and user-friendly for a wide range of users, regardless of their technical expertise or background.
